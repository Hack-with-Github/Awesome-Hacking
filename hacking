Hackers are breaking into private code repositories, wiping them, and asking their owners for a ransom to restore their projects.

Ransomware, a type of attack where hackers infect computers, encrypt their content, and ask for money in exchange for a decryption key that will restore their data, has been around for decades. This new attack is a little different, but itâ€™s unclear how successful it will be since one victim has claimed to have found a way to recover their code without paying the ransom.
